### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The foundation of knowledge starts here.

I am starting this on January 9th 2023 to begin my journey into CI/CD and whatever else comes along. I am not sure entirely where it will take me, but I do feel driven & motivation on this path. I think that If I can find something that feels good to learn, experience and build, I can fully apply myself. I had an opportunity, but had to pass on it regretfully as I did not feel that it was the correct decision at that time. Fast forward a few months and I've been stagnant. I believe that this project will turn into something and be the basis of my "Foundation" down the road.

V/r,
